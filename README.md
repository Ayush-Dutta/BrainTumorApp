# üß† Brain Tumor Detection and Classification Web App

This is a Flask-based web application that allows users to upload MRI images for brain tumor **detection** and **classification**. The app uses deep learning models to analyze MRI scans and determine whether a tumor is present and, if so, what type of tumor it is.

It also features a hospital locator to find nearby hospitals based on your current location.
